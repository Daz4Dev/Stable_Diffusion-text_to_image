# Stable_Diffusion-text_to_image
The project aims to demonstrate the generation of images based on textual prompts using a stable diffusion model and GPT-2, leveraging PyTorch and Hugging Face.
It was implemented on Google Colab, taking advantage of the free T4 GPU access. This significantly accelerated the runtime compared to running the code in a local environment.
To operate - 
   Run the file on Colab with runtime set to GPU instead of CPU.
